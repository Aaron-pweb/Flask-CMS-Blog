      Hi, I'm Aaron — a developer and creative builder who enjoys turning ideas
      into clean, functional, and visually clear experiences on the web. I love
      experimenting with new technologies, improving my design workflow, and
      learning something new every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is my personal space on the internet where I share projects,
      thoughts, experiments, and things I’m currently exploring. Whether it's
      front-end development, UI/UX, or small creative tools, I enjoy creating
      things that feel simple and purposeful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of coding, I’m always looking for ways to improve—whether that’s
      learning new skills, trying out new hobbies, or connecting with people who
      enjoy building cool things. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to
      reach out anytime!
